Models Sample
==============

Included here are several Model Samples. They include a Fritzing layout, along with a couple of 3D builds I've recently completed. (Recently = within the last year.) I've included the original files in their native format, plus .jpg images of each.
The safe and safe cracker were all modeled by measurements. All safe models were done in Solidworks, while the Marble Machine was done in Vectorworks, the 3D design tool of choice throughout the professional theatre world.
